# Water Potability Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project predicts the potability of water using machine learning models trained on physicochemical parameters.  
It includes **data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and SHAP-based explainability**, along with a **Flask API** and **ServiceNow custom application** for real-time predictions.

## Key Results
- Random Forest achieved **95.65% accuracy** with balanced class handling  
- SHAP analysis identified **pH, Sulfate, and Solids** as critical features  
- ServiceNow integration enabled **sub-10s automated incident creation** for unsafe samples  

## Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript (ServiceNow scripting)  
- **Libraries:** scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP, Pandas, Matplotlib  
- **Platform:** ServiceNow (REST, Business Rules, Flow Designer)  
- **Deployment:** Flask API, Postman, Hugging Face Spaces  

## Outcomes
- Built an end-to-end ML pipeline with explainability  
- Demonstrated real-time water quality monitoring
